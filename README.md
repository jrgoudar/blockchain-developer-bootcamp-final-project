blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project

a blockchain project to pickup and drop off kids to school based on a token system to make sure all parents are participating equally.

Each parent is identified by his/her private key. 
The transaction is created/updated during its life using blockchain to keep an immutable record of the number of trips .
The system will keep track of parents getting added to the carpool and getting out.
There will be restricitions on when the parents can get added/removed
There will be guard rails so the parents share the carpool rides in an equal number.
Even if they do some extra, they other parents will have to pitch in more the next block or they cant get blacklisted.
